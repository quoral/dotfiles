# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible, gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - What changed that could cause this?
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   WHEN system has multiple components:
   - Log what data enters/exits each component
   - Verify environment/config propagation
   - Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   - THEN investigate that specific component

5. **Trace Data Flow**
   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom
   - See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete technique

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples** - Locate similar working code in same codebase
2. **Compare Against References** - Read reference implementations COMPLETELY
3. **Identify Differences** - List every difference, however small
4. **Understand Dependencies** - What other components, settings, config does this need?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis** - "I think X is the root cause because Y"
2. **Test Minimally** - SMALLEST possible change, one variable at a time
3. **Verify Before Continuing** - Worked? Phase 4. Didn't? NEW hypothesis, don't pile fixes

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case** - Simplest possible reproduction, MUST have before fixing
2. **Implement Single Fix** - Address root cause, ONE change, no "while I'm here" improvements
3. **Verify Fix** - Test passes? No other tests broken? Issue resolved?
4. **If Fix Doesn't Work** - Count attempts. If >= 3: STOP and question the architecture
5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**
   - Each fix reveals new problems in different places = architectural problem
   - Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than thrashing |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms != understanding root cause |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem |

## Supporting Techniques

Available in this directory:
- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling
